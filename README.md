# Online Course Management System

This repository contains the code for an **Online Course Management System** developed in **C++**. The system allows students to browse, enroll in, and purchase online courses. It showcases key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, such as **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation**.

## Project Overview

The system offers the following features for students:

- **Browse Available Courses**: Students can view details of the available courses, including the course name, price, instructor, prerequisites, and more.
- **Enroll in Courses**: Students can add courses to their cart and enroll in them.
- **Purchase Courses**: Students can proceed to checkout and purchase courses.
- **Student Login**: Students can log in using their student number and password to access personalized features and manage their account.
- **Rate Courses**: After purchasing courses, students can provide feedback by rating the course on a scale from 1 to 5.

## Key Features

### 1. **OnlineCourse (Abstract Base Class)**

The `OnlineCourse` class is the base class for all course types. It contains common properties and methods used by all courses, such as:

- **Attributes**:
  - Course name
  - Instructor
  - Difficulty level
  - Price
  - Discount rate
  - Prerequisites
- **Methods**:
  - Display course information
  - Check course availability
  - Enroll students
  - Manage course ratings

### 2. **SoftwareCourses**

The `SoftwareCourses` class inherits from `OnlineCourse` and is used to represent software-related courses such as C++, Python, and Java. Additional attributes specific to software courses include:

- Programming language
- Development environment

### 3. **MathCourses**

The `MathCourses` class inherits from `OnlineCourse` and represents math-related courses, such as Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics. It includes the following:

- Focus areas like differential and integral calculus
- Advanced mathematical concepts

### 4. **ProfessionalDevelopmentCourses**

This class, which also inherits from `OnlineCourse`, represents professional development courses. These courses focus on topics like leadership, communication skills, and team management. Additional features include:

- Certification options
- Focus on career development

### 5. **LanguageCourses**

The `LanguageCourses` class inherits from `OnlineCourse` and represents courses designed to teach languages (e.g., English for Business). It has attributes such as:

- Language being taught
- Instructorâ€™s native language status

### 6. **Cart**

The `Cart` class manages the student's shopping cart. It allows students to:

- Add courses to the cart
- View the contents of the cart
- Proceed to checkout
- Ensure that courses are available before completing the purchase

### 7. **Student Authentication**

The system implements a basic student login system. Students can log in using their student number and password. Once logged in, they can browse, enroll in, and purchase courses.

## UML Class Diagram

The UML Class Diagram below shows how the classes are related:

- **Inheritance**: `SoftwareCourses`, `MathCourses`, `ProfessionalDevelopmentCourses`, and `LanguageCourses` inherit from `OnlineCourse`.
- **Aggregation**: The `Cart` class aggregates `OnlineCourse` objects.
- **Composition**: The `Student` class holds references to `OnlineCourse` objects representing the enrolled courses.
